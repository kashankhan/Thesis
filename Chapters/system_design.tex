\chapter{System Design and Implementation}

This chapter describes of the system. It starts by providing overview of the system, followed by requirement elicitation to build prototype. Furthermore, it also provide deeper understanding of architectural paradigm by discussing each module and their interconnection.

\section{Overview}

Pervious chapter limits our discussion about the design decision and describe the essential component of the system.  Since the concept is quite abstract and does not dictate any implementation details.  In order to challenge the relevance and capability of the concept, a prototype app, tailored to a real world scenario, should be developed as a “proof of concept”. Our system is divided in to two components: (1) Web based application follows modular principle of system design i.e. functionality of a system is divided into multiple concurrent modules.
