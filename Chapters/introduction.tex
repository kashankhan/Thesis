Recommender systems are increasingly used in e-commerce websites, because they give businesses a strategic advantage over businesses without them. Recommender systems can be described as an information filtering technology that is used to present information on items to the user that are in line with the users tastes. These systems involve predictive models, heuristic search, data collection, user interaction and model maintenance. In other words we can see recommender systems as smart search engines which gather information on users and or items in order to give customized recommendations by comparing users and or items with each other.\newline

This smart search is achieved with help of historical data on products and customers. For instance the historical data can consist of ratings given by customers on products or another possibility is that previously purchased items are used. The historical data consists of information on items and customers. Businesses often have a large variety of products that are for sale. As the number of products increase customers will have more difficulty finding what they like. Recommender systems offer a solution as they are designed to provide customers with recommendations. As recommendations reduce the amount of time a customer needs to invest in searching for products of his or her liking, the overall userâ€™s experience is positive.\newline
