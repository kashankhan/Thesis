The motiviation behind this Master Thesis is to implement and evaluate a Healthy Food Recommendation System for Mobile. In the beginning, it provides overview and give the reasonsing about the selection of system. Relevant background and related work is presented, Followed by the development and design process together with the evaluation process will be presented. \newline

This chapter will enlighten the motivation behind develped system in Section 1.1. Followed by goals in Section 1.2. Whereas Section 1.3 will provide a breif outline on structure of thesis.

\section{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Rapid innovation and significant advancement in the field of technology and scientific research has made smartphone a primary computing and communication device. Smartphone is now become a necessity of life and people use it as an assistant for their day to day work. According to latest survey more than half of Internet traffic is accounted by mobile device 

Although total Internet usage on mobile devices has previously exceeded that on PCs, this is the first time it's happened for app usage alone.

In engineering sciences, the term \textit{Architecture} has great significance. Similarly, if we talk about Software Engineering in particular, the importance of \textit{Software Architecture} cannot be neglected. It becomes an important activity in software development life cycle. In this modern era of complex software systems, the design and overall structure (Software Architecture) of a system are more significant aspects than the choice of algorithms and the data structures.\newline

\section{Goals}
The goal of this thesis is to find a way to prioritize architecture violations using findings from implementation compliance analysis tool. \\In order to achieve this goal, we need to know:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{What is a dependency in software architecture?}\newline
				Do some literature work in order to understand the term Dependency in context of Software Architecture.
	\item \textbf{Which dependencies are important for the practitioners?} \newline
				Conduct interviews with practitioners at Intel to ask: \newline
				- What is a Dependency? \newline
				- Which Dependencies are relevant? \newline
				- How to prioritize them?	 
	\item \textbf{How to prioritize these dependencies in a real world environment?} \newline
				Create a Tolerated dependency model
				Create a review module for the dependency violations		
\end{itemize}
